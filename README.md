# Computer-Network
Computer Network - Assignments - Spring 2022
## Final Project
In this assignment we create a simple chatroom by first creating a pair of server
and client which communicate via a certain port, and next implementing functions
such as sending and displaying messages including sender’s and recipent’s names
in a common environment acting as a chatroom.
## Wireshark Labs
Wireshark is a traffic control and analysis software used in computer networks. We mostly used it for investigating packets communicated in different protocol schemes.
